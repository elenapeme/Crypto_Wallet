# Crypto_Wallet

First of all you should install the npm dependencies with npm install in each folder. One on the front folder and other on the back one.
You should have an available .env in order to make the backend work.
Take into account that this app is still in progress, there is room for improvement, which I would like to do from now on.
Thank you!
